# React Template Project with created navigation and some scss files to the pages.


If you need to create some project on React you can use this template.
The template contains a Navigation menu linked to the pages implemented with React Navigation Routing.
Navigation Bar contains a logo and social media icons sections.
Also, some scss classes are prepared for use.






```
Please run

npm i 
npm i react-dom
npm i react-router-dom

and check the package.json file for the missing dependencies if something is not running.

```

## Thanks and Good Luck!
