If you need to create some project on React you can use this template.
The template contains a Navigation menu linked to the pages implemented with 
React Navigation Routing.




```
Please make 

npm i 
npm i react-dom
npm i react-router-dom

and check the package-lock.json file for the missing dependencies if something is not running.


```
